It is a tiny app I am making while trying to learn more about MAUI C# development.

I am using it to help me manage / follow issues that I suffer because of Crohns Disease. It might not be up to your usual standard but the idea for me is that it is something functional that I can use to assist me everyday.

I am happy for you to contribute, whether it be just ideas or with code improvements, I am learning MAUI basics with this app, so I don't expect it to be trailblazing, I will improve the codebase as I learn or as features dictate.
